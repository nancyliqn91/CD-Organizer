* Run the app, first navigate to this project's production directory called "MusicOrganizer". 
* In the command line, run `dotnet run` in the "MusicOrganizer" directory to run the console app. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal. 
* Optionally, you can run `dotnet build` to compile this console app without running it.
* To optionally run the test, open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's test directory called "MusicOrganizer.Tests".
